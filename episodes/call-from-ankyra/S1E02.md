### Long Synopsis

An unexpected roundup sweeps through the market district, with Gray Cloaks dragging suspected dissenters into makeshift tribunals. Maxim, caught in the crowd, witnesses the arbitrary brutality and notes the efficiency with which fear is refreshed. He begins to suspect the purges are not about rooting out specific threats, but about maintaining a rhythm of intimidation that keeps the entire populace aligned.
