### Long Synopsis

Under the cover of a centuries-old ritual in which masked performers duel in the streets, several targeted assassinations are carried out against council loyalists. The chaos provides Maxim an opening to access the Archive’s main control chamber — but the revelry turns violent, spilling into unplanned districts. The line between celebration and slaughter vanishes in the torchlight.
