### Long Synopsis

A packet of letters, smuggled to Maxim through a chain of street children, bears the seal of Calyra — a name unknown to him. The writings hint at underground resistance, but the tone is personal, as if she already knows who he truly is. Each letter contains subtle references to harmonic concepts he thought only tower-world engineers understood. The possibility of offworld awareness within the city disturbs him.
