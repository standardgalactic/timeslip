### Long Synopsis

A final letter from Calyra reaches Maxim, smuggled in a hollow spindle. It is both a farewell and a warning: “The Archive is opening.” She writes of escalating purges, disappearing scholars, and a sudden tightening of council decrees. The tone is frantic, almost desperate, and the letter ends mid-sentence. Maxim realizes the message was likely intercepted and altered before it reached him.
