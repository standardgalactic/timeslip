### Long Synopsis

Behind closed doors, the city’s ruling council dons elaborate ceremonial masks to debate policy. The practice, Maxim learns, is older than the current regime, meant to depersonalize authority and preserve continuity. Yet the masks themselves are wired with small harmonic coils, their purpose undisclosed. Maxim risks photographing the array — a move that could expose both him and the council’s reliance on unseen technology.
