Noble feast vs street rot; Maxim shows no disgust.

---

### Long Synopsis

Invited to a noble feast under the pretext of “studying culture,” Maxim experiences the jarring gap between opulence and street life. Candlelit halls overflow with wine, music, and gossip — but the rear windows open onto gutters where beggars freeze in the drizzle. The sensory collision forces Maxim to reconsider the nature of his non-interference orders: to remain silent in the face of such disparity feels like complicity.
