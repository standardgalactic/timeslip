### Long Synopsis

COMCON-2 recalls Maxim to debrief on his “failed containment.” As he prepares to leave, he sees the city from the river — a patchwork of smoke, banners, and silence. Whether Ankyra will rebuild or dissolve is unknowable. His departure is shadowed by the thought that the true cost of interference is not the chaos it creates, but the certainty that he will never see what comes after.
