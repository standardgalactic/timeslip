### Long Synopsis

The aftermath of the failed coup leaves the city fractured into competing zones of control. The Gray Cloaks patrol the central districts with doubled strength, while outer wards slip into the hands of opportunistic gangs and self-appointed “defenders of order.” Maxim navigates this unstable terrain to keep contact with both factions, knowing each believes he might be useful — though for very different ends. The sense of a city at the brink is palpable, and interference now seems inevitable.
