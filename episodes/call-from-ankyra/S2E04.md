### Long Synopsis

In a tense, firelit meeting, Rumata — a charismatic figure long whispered about in Calyra’s letters — reveals himself as another embedded observer. Unlike Maxim, he has openly interfered, positioning himself as a masked folk hero in the hinterlands. Their conversation is a clash of philosophies: Rumata insists that to see suffering and do nothing is moral cowardice, while Maxim warns of the unforeseen spirals that follow meddling in closed systems.
