Pre-collapse tech under palace: a damaged crystal core.

### Long Synopsis

Rumors surface of a subterranean vault beneath the council hall — the so-called Black Archive — where crystalline resonators are stored. These relics, older than the current regime, can capture and replay harmonic commands without a live operator. Maxim infiltrates a service tunnel to glimpse the devices, confirming they match offworld designs thought to have been decommissioned centuries ago. The discovery deepens his suspicion that Ankyra was not merely influenced, but engineered.
