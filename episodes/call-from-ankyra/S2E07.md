### Long Synopsis

In the northern wards, Maxim discovers Ari — a technician from his own world, presumed dead — living under an assumed name. Ari has been secretly repairing coil arrays to broadcast coded “echoes” into the offworld void, hoping to signal COMCON-2. The signals, however, are being partially absorbed and distorted by unknown harmonic interference, making it impossible to know who else might be listening.
