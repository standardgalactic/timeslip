### Long Synopsis

The Scholar, a frail but sharp-eyed man, is put on public trial for “academic heresy.” Maxim attends under the guise of a cultural observer. The proceedings are less about argument than performance — scripted questions, rehearsed condemnations, and a verdict decided long before the first witness. Maxim catches the Scholar’s gaze in the crowd and sees a flicker of recognition, as though the old man knows the truth of his origin.
