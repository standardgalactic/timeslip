### Long Synopsis

Maxim attends a temple ceremony where priests chant over a mud-filled altar. The rite is meant to cleanse the city’s spiritual impurities, but the ritual’s focus on filth — embraced, exalted, then symbolically drowned — leaves him unsettled. His report to COMCON-2 notes the uncanny parallel between the ceremony’s cadence and the old tower broadcast intervals, but he is warned to keep such theories off official record.
