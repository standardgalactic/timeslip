### Long Synopsis

Under the name “Anton,” Maxim Kammerer arrives in Arkanar posing as a wandering historian from a remote province. The city is a swamp-choked maze of leaning stone, open sewers, and rain-slick cobbles, where mud tides flood the lower floors and rats gleam in the drizzle.

At the city’s heart stands a rust-black steeple—eerily akin to the Thought Control Towers of a previous world—long “dead” by local account, yet giving off faint, dreamlike field fluctuations.

Anton blends in by mimicking dialect, hiding his sterilizing tech, and logging observations in coded bursts to COMCON-2. But the moral weight of what he sees presses in: preventable disease, casual cruelty, and a structure that may not be as inert as it seems. On his second night, the steeple tolls a low, subsonic bell no one else hears—a sound he recognizes as a systems test.
