### Long Synopsis

A mysterious figure offers Maxim access to the city’s resonance archives in exchange for a “miracle” — the reactivation of a dormant shrine coil said to bring rain. The task is technically simple but politically explosive, as it would cement the priesthood’s authority. Maxim must weigh the lure of unprecedented access against the risk of altering the city’s balance of power irreversibly.
