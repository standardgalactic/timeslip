### Long Synopsis

A creeping malaise grips the city: victims lose not only their memories, but entire blocks of skill and habit, leaving them unable to feed or clothe themselves. The affliction spreads faster than any known pathogen. Maxim learns the “disease” is being driven by corrupted harmonic pulses, possibly broadcast through the city’s coil network. The line between plague and weapon blurs, and the question of who — or what — is behind it becomes urgent.
