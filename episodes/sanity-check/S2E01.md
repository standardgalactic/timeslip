### Long Synopsis

Maxim’s latest assignment takes him upriver to the ash-lands, where the water runs black from centuries-old burn scars in the hills. Here, the towers are fewer and the Calls weaker, their crystal arrays fogged with neglect. Villagers walk with less slump to their shoulders, meeting his eyes directly — a dangerous difference from the city’s bowed heads.
One evening, an old woman sketches in the dust: a rough map showing the river’s fork, marked with a symbol he recognizes from forbidden COMCON-2 files. It suggests the hinterlands were once self-governing enclaves, left alone until the towers’ reach extended. At night, the wind carries a different kind of hum — not the subharmonic of obedience, but something ragged and alive.
