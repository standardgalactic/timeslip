### Long Synopsis

Maxim finally gains access to the long-rumored Ninth Tower — a resonance core still humming at partial capacity. Inside, he finds layers of jury-rigged repairs, graffiti from past infiltrators, and a chamber lined with harmonic crystals. The tower holds records of every pulse ever broadcast on Ankyra, along with a dormant “last frequency” signal that could overwrite the entire network.
