### Long Synopsis

Rain turns the streets to black slurry as Shavri slips into the beacon alcove, guided by the code Maxim thought was theoretical. The beacon’s pulse cuts through the storm, and in minutes she’s gone — pulled into an orbital shuttle whose crew will never acknowledge her presence.
Maxim hears about it only in fragments: a delayed uplink, a change in background noise. Officially, Shavri was never extracted. Unofficially, she’s the first person to leave this world in decades. In the tower’s shadow, Maxim wonders what else COMCON-2 has been hiding from him.
