### Long Synopsis

The Scholar’s lectures begin to fragment, sentences breaking mid-thought as if an unseen signal interrupts him. Diagrams scrawled in chalk are increasingly abstract, resembling harmonic maps rather than historical timelines. Maxim suspects partial resonance overexposure, but each attempt to diagnose is met with hostility. When the Scholar finally collapses mid-class, the patterns on the board are already being copied and traded as contraband.
