### Long Synopsis

Rain slicks the cobbles as Maxim positions himself in the shadow of a shrine, lens aimed at the tower’s crystal array. Moments before the Call, the instruments pick up a subharmonic vibration — too low for local ears, too deliberate for accident. It seeps into the stones, into his boots, vibrating bone more than air.
He transmits the recording to orbit, expecting interest; instead, Thal’s voice comes back cold: “Stay behind the lens. Do not become a participant.” Yet as the Call washes over the square, he can’t help noticing that the subharmonic comes first, as if priming the crowd’s nervous systems for compliance.
