### Long Synopsis

In the city archives, a clerk complains of a ‘ledger jump’ — names shifting columns overnight, obedience schedules out of sync. The result is subtle: small groups missing their Calls, moving with a freedom that lasts hours before the next broadcast catches them.
Maxim seizes the moment to shadow one such group. They laugh more, speak faster, argue openly about food prices. When the next Call comes, the change is abrupt — smiles gone, posture bent. Maxim transmits the ledger glitch upstream, but COMCON-2’s reply is a flat: “Maintain observation. Do not intervene.”
