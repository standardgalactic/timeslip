### Long Synopsis

The market square in Calyra is alive with voices — real voices, unmodulated by tower harmonics. At the center stands a young woman with a voice like struck bronze, rallying the crowd with stories of a time before the Calls. Her cadence has the exact rhythm of known pre-Tower dissenters archived in COMCON-2’s restricted vaults.
Maxim keeps his lens low, pretending to examine trinkets, but he’s recording every syllable. Later, a courier slips him a scrap of cloth from her banner; under magnification, it’s threaded with microprint so fine the locals could never have woven it. Someone offworld is feeding her the language of revolt.
