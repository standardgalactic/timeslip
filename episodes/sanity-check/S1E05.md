Shavri weaves messages; Myra’s ‘dust storms’ hint HQ unrest.

---

### Long Synopsis

A drizzle turns to downpour as Maxim meets Shavri under a sagging awning. She hands him a strip of damp weaving, colors bleeding just enough to disguise the pattern from casual eyes. As he decodes it later, Myra’s voice crackles over the comm, complaining about “dust storms” interfering with uplink — her code for bureaucratic infighting back on COMCON-2.
In the weaving’s tight cross-stitches is a map of names and meeting points. Shavri watches his eyes as he scans it, as if gauging whether he can be trusted with more.
