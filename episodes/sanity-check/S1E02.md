### Long Synopsis

Two days of etiquette simulations — when to bow, which phrases to avoid, how to disguise disinterest as devotion — do nothing to prepare Maxim for the market’s crush. The smell hits first: wet wool, fermented grain, hot grease frying somewhere unseen. Stalls sag under piles of root vegetables and hand-spun cloth. He wears a mask appropriate for a newcomer craftsman, humble but not servile.
Among the crowd, a young woman’s hands flash across a weaving frame — not the steady rhythm of ordinary work, but an intricate patterning that twitches against the eye, as if meant to be read. Shavri, he learns later. She brushes past him, slipping something into his pocket. That night, in his rented room above the inn, Maxim finds it: a pendant that hums faintly under the lens, its weave concealing a micro-transmitter. He does not report it.
