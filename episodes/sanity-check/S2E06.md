### Long Synopsis

In the kiln district, every building sweats steam and ash, the air thick enough to taste. Maxim follows a lead about unusual heat signatures and finds an old pottery furnace glowing at the wrong hours. Inside, instead of clay, are crystal shards and coiled copper.
The arrangement is unmistakable: a crude signal booster. The firings mask bursts of static that, when decoded later, form coordinates far beyond tower reach. Someone is transmitting through the cover of artisanal work.
