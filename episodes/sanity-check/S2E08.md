‘Fix it or break it’ ultimatum from Mechanic.

---

### Long Synopsis

Back in the dim workshop, the Quiet Mechanic stands over a disassembled tower relay, hands black with grease. Without looking up, he tells Maxim there’s a choice: repair the relay to full function, or leave it in its current state of quiet decay.
“I can fix this,” the Mechanic says, “or I can let it die. But not both.” His eyes meet Maxim’s for the first time, searching for the truth of his allegiance. Maxim leaves without answering, the hum of dormant machinery following him out the door.
