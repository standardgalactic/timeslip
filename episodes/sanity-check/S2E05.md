### Long Synopsis

A walled garden outside the university contains a strange symmetry. The plants are arranged in spirals and ratios Maxim recognizes from field harmonics diagrams. In the center, a scholar tends the beds, feigning ignorance when Maxim comments on the pattern. Later, Shavri’s coded weaving arrives with a single phrase: “Read from above.”
Using a borrowed glide-drone, Maxim sees the full design — a map of all towers in the region, and the rivers that bypass them. It’s not decoration. It’s strategy.
