### Long Synopsis

A streetwise youth survives direct exposure to a harmonic coil without convulsions. Maxim takes the “Apprentice” under observation, testing for anomalies in hearing, balance, and mental resilience. The boy seems able to hear a background chord inaudible to others, granting him uncanny timing in crowds. Rumors of his immunity draw attention from factions who see him as a weapon — or a key.
