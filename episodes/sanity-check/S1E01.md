### Long Synopsis

In the antiseptic white of COMCON-2’s debriefing chamber, Maxim sits under a light too bright to be comfortable, answering Dr. Keryn Thal’s clipped questions. His psych profile scrolls in mid-air, a neat cascade of risk-flags: empathy suppression, recall anomalies, immunity confirmed. Outside the viewport, the target planet rolls beneath them — oceanic green swirled with brown deltas and a scatter of tiny, pale-topped cities.
They descend on a schedule designed for minimal cultural disruption, skimming the atmosphere at dawn. Maxim peers through the lens array at a tower-dominated settlement; from one tower, the first Call is broadcast. He sees the change ripple through the populace — shoulders slacken, heads tip back, a synchronized intake of breath. The nanobots in his blood do nothing, of course, so he drops into a theatrical shiver, eyes wetting just enough to sell the ecstasy. In his ear, Archive Node 7 murmurs timestamps and vitals, like a priest cataloguing miracles. By the time they land at the remote riverport, Maxim is already memorizing the cadence of their voices.
