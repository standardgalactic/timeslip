### Recap (from data.js)
Live uplink loyalty test; shrine scene forces Maxim to perform ecstasy.

---

### Long Synopsis

The shrine’s inner chamber glows with candlelight, its floor slick with wax drippings. Thal’s voice, crisp over the uplink, demands a demonstration: a local priest approaches, offering the communal cup. Maxim drinks, lets the incense-heavy air fill his lungs, and feigns the slack-jawed bliss of the Called. The lens on his collar records every tremor of eyelid and lip for COMCON-2’s behavioral analysts.
Inside, his pulse stays steady. Outside, the crowd sways as one.
