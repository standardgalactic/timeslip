### Long Synopsis

Rolen, older and more cautious, corners Maxim in a riverside alley, warning that COMCON-2 is preparing recall orders. “They’ll scrub everything,” he says, meaning witnesses, too. That night, Shavri describes a ‘sky-track’ she can see on certain nights — the shuttle’s invisible descent corridor. She wants to follow it, to leave. Maxim doesn’t commit. In the distance, the tower hum wavers, as if considering its own escape.
