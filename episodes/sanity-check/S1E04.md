### Long Synopsis

The workshop is a cathedral of dust-draped machinery, shafts of light cutting through air that smells of scorched oil and old crystal. The Quiet Mechanic barely looks up as Maxim enters, fingers deep in a gear-and-crystal assembly older than any tower. The man communicates in nods and half-sentences, but every surface tells a story: scoring marks in a language Maxim doesn’t recognize, insulation grown brittle with centuries.
When asked where the devices came from, the Mechanic just says, “They were here when I arrived.” Maxim leaves with the image of a gear-teeth fracture burned into his mind — a break he’s sure he’s seen in offworld archives.
