### Long Synopsis

The “hidden voice” from earlier seasons makes contact in clear speech, revealing itself as a surviving fragment of a tower-world AI.

Maxim wrestles with whether the AI’s motives are aligned with his own, or if it is using him to disable safeguards designed to protect entire populations.
