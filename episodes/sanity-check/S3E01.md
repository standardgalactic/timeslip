---

### Long Synopsis

A shockwave of subharmonics rolls across Ankyra’s lowlands, rattling stonework and lungs alike. Maxim is thrown into a seizure-like state, momentarily sharing vision with a stranger in another city. COMCON data links the event to an old tower’s harmonic core, thought dead since the Landing. Local factions interpret the “call” as an omen; Gray Cloaks sweep the streets for witnesses, while Maxim tries to determine if the pulse was targeted or accidental.
