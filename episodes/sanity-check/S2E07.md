### Long Synopsis

The Festival begins before sunrise, with the entire city gathered in the main square. Lanterns swing overhead, casting moving constellations on the wet cobblestones. At the exact moment the first light touches the tower’s highest crystal, a low tone rolls through the crowd — the Call, disguised as celebration.
Maxim realizes the ritual serves a double purpose: it’s cultural glue and obedience reinforcement at once. His lens catches the microsecond where faces shift from joy to blank serenity, a pivot so fast it’s almost imperceptible.
