### Long Synopsis

Recovering from his breakdown, the Scholar invites Maxim to a sealed archive beneath the university. Inside are handmade “beacons” — small harmonic resonators built in secret over decades, each pre-programmed with coordinates far outside Ankyra. The devices appear to be part of an evacuation network, designed to summon help or transport when the last frequency falls silent. Maxim must decide whether to trigger one, risking exposure.
