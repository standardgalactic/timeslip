### Long Synopsis

A strange aurora of audio static rolls over Ankyra, seeding every unshielded coil with faint, ghostlike harmonics. Within the distortion, Maxim detects a familiar modulation pattern — the same signature from his first assignment on the tower world. He realizes the transmission is a recontact attempt, possibly from COMCON or another observer. But decoding it risks revealing his position to both local factions and offworld operators.
