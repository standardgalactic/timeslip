### Long Synopsis

An underground workshop begins emitting deliberate counter-waves, erasing the bloom’s imprint from certain districts. The Gray Cloaks frame it as a “public cleansing,” but Maxim knows the pattern is tuned to cancel more than static — it’s targeting resonance immunity. He must navigate between two competing signal webs, each claiming to protect the city, while covertly preserving a copy of the original bloom code.
