### Long Synopsis

An unauthorized transmission hijacks every speaking-tube, bell-tower, and signal horn in the city, delivering a single resonant phrase before the network dies. The Mechanic recognizes it as a shutdown code — one that could disable an entire chain of resonance nodes. As panic spreads, Maxim races to determine whether this was an act of mercy, sabotage, or the opening move in a wider campaign.
