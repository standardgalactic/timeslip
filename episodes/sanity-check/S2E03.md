### Long Synopsis

A tower’s crystal facet has fractured, scattering the Call into disharmonic echoes. From his vantage on a nearby roof, Maxim watches the harmonic engineers at work — their tools more akin to surgical instruments than mechanical ones. Every time they align a facet, the hum deepens, a bass that presses against his eardrums.
He slips into the maintenance records, finding that this is the third such ‘accident’ in as many months. The fractures form patterns — too precise for weathering, too irregular for structural stress. Sabotage is the only explanation, but by whom?
