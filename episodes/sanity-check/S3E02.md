### Long Synopsis

The elusive Mechanic finally allows Maxim into his inner workshop — a catacomb of salvaged drives, harmonic coils, and relic consoles. Through cryptic stories and reconstructed schematics, Maxim begins to piece together the Mechanic’s origin: not born in Ankyra, but smuggled in from a defunct tower world. Every hint points toward a long-suppressed network linking multiple planets through resonance nodes.
