### Long Synopsis

An intercepted transmission contains a faint human voice layered under noise — warning Maxim by name to leave the city before the next pulse. Audio analysis shows impossible phase-shifts, as if the message was recorded in multiple dimensions of time. Tracing the source leads Maxim through flooded tunnels and abandoned relay stations, where graffiti in ancient glyphs repeats the same warning.
