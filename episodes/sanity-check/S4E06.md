### Long Synopsis

Calyra proposes a risky experiment: merging the bloom code with counter-harmonic patterns to create a stable, free-flowing resonance channel. The Mechanic warns this could irreversibly alter every node in the network. As factions assemble to witness the test, Maxim must choose whether to lend his expertise — knowing it could either mend the resonance divide or shatter the city’s last cohesive system.
