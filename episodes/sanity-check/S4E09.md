### Long Synopsis

The long-awaited orders arrive: secure or neutralize the Ninth Tower, and prepare for extraction. Maxim realizes following them will erase years of embedded work and betray every local alliance. Defying them could strand him permanently. In the final moments, the bloom, counter-harmonics, and last frequency collide in a layered broadcast — one that will echo far beyond Ankyra, into worlds yet unseen.
