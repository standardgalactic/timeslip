### Long Synopsis

At dawn, the usual crystal-hum from the north tower is absent. The square fills anyway, people restless, looking upward as if sheer expectation will bring the Call. Shavri finds him in the crowd, eyes sharp. “Is your mind quiet?” she asks, not waiting for an answer. Her fingers twitch with the start of a code pattern, but she stops, scanning the rooftops for watchers.
Later, Maxim records the silence itself — a baseline, perhaps, against which future disruptions can be measured.
