### Long Synopsis

One night, the Call stutters mid-broadcast, replaced by a rush of static. Beneath the noise is a voice — faint, offworld-accented, speaking his name. He records it, plays it back, filters the layers until it’s clear: “Anton, extraction possible. Not alone.”
It’s the first direct offworld contact he’s had since Shavri vanished. COMCON-2’s denial arrives almost instantly: “No such signal detected.” Maxim keeps the recording anyway, backing it up in three hidden caches.
