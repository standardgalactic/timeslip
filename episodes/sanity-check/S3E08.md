### Long Synopsis

Ari, now openly aligned with Calyra’s faction, leads a raid to liberate prisoners wearing the new resonance chains. Maxim follows, recording the sequence of harmonic “keynotes” used to undo the restraints. But during the escape, Ari is caught in a feedback loop between two unlocked coils, risking neural collapse. The rescue comes at a cost — the keys are now known to multiple factions.
