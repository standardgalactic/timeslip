### Long Synopsis

Calyra’s oratory gains a strange timbre after the latest pulse, her speeches capable of quieting angry mobs or inciting frenzy without apparent effort. Maxim observes subtle synchrony in listeners’ breathing and heartbeats, suggesting low-frequency entrainment. The effect spreads through taverns, markets, and guild halls, reshaping local politics. Maxim must choose between documenting a sociological anomaly or counteracting a force that could topple city order.
